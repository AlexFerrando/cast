# Activation Steering

ðŸ‘‰ (Nov-2024) Colab Demos Added!

ðŸ‘‰ (Sep-2024) Preprint Released! [***Programming Refusal with Conditional Activation Steering***](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05907) on arXiv

## Overview

This is a general-purpose activation steering library to (1) extract vectors and (2) steer model behavior. We release this library alongside our recent report on *Programming Refusal with Conditional Activation Steering* to provide an intuitive toolchain for activation steering efforts.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IBM/activation-steering

pip install -e activation-steering
```

## Activation Steering
Activation steering is a technique for influencing the behavior of language models by modifying their internal activations during inference. This library provides tools for:

- Extracting steering vectors from contrastive examples
- Applying steering vectors to modify model behavior

## Conditional Activation Steering
Conditional activation steering selectively applies or withholds activation steering based on the input context. Conditional activation steering extends the activation steering framework by introducing:

- Context-dependent control capabilities through condition vectors
- Logical composition of multiple condition vectors 

For detailed implementation and usage of both activation steering and conditional activation steering, refer to our paper and the documentation.

## Documentation
Refer to /docs to understand this library. We recommend starting with Quick Start Tutorial as it covers most concepts that you need to get started with activation steering and conditional activation steering.
